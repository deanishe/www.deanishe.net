### Modes ###

| Name            | Key                        | Description                                    |
| --              | --                         | --                                             |
| normal          | `<ESC>`                    | Navigate document                              |
| insert          | `i` or `I` (insert at end) | For entering text                              |
| plain visual    | `v`                        | For navigation and manipulation of text        |

### Window & buffer management ###

|      Mapping      |  Command   |                     Action                     |
|-------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `CTRL+w -`        | `:split`   | Split window horizontally                      |
| `CTRL+w /`        |            | Split window vertically                        |
| `CTRL+w c`        | `:close`   | Close current window                           |
| `CTRL+k`/`CTRL+j` |            | Move to window above/below                     |
| `CTRL+h`/`CTRL+l` |            | Move to window to left/right                   |
|                   | `:bdelete` | Delete current buffer (closes window)          |
|                   | `:Bclose`  | Close current buffer (leaves window unchanged) |


### Code folding

Vim can't fold some filetypes by default. Add a `python.vim` file to
`~/.vim/after/ftplugin` or any file to `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/python/` with the
following content:

```viml
set foldmethod=indent
set foldnestmax=2
set foldlevel=2
" show a folding status bar on the left-hand side
set foldcolumn=1
```

This will set reasonable defaults (2 levels is method-level) and open the folds.

Control folds with the following commands:

| Mapping         | Action                          |
| --------------- | ------                          |
| `zo`            | Open current fold               |
| `zO`            | Open current fold recursively   |
| `zc`            | Close current fold              |
| `zf`            | Create a fold (in visual mode)  |
| `zf{motion}`    | Create a fold (in normal mode)  |
| `zd`            | Delete current fold             |
| `zD`            | Delete current fold recursively |
| `za`            | Toggle current fold             |
| `zA`            | Toggle current fold recursively |
| `zm`            | Fold more                       |
| `zr`            | Fold less                       |
| `zM`            | Fold everything                 |
| `zR`            | Unfold everything               |
| `:help folding` | VIM's own help                  |

### Search & Replace ###


#### Basics ####

`:%s/foo/bar/g`
: Find each occurrence of `foo` (in all lines), and replace it with `bar`.

`:s/foo/bar/g`
: Find each occurrence of `foo` (in the current line only), and replace it with `bar`.

`:%s/foo/bar/gc`
: Change each `foo` to `bar`, but ask for confirmation first.

`:%s/\<foo\>/bar/gc`
: Change only whole words exactly matching `foo` to `bar`; ask for confirmation.

`:%s/foo/bar/gci`
: Change each `foo` (case insensitive) to `bar`; ask for confirmation.

This may be wanted after using `:set noignorecase` to make searches case
sensitive (the default).

`:%s/foo/bar/gcI`
: Change each `foo` (case sensitive) to `bar`; ask for confirmation. This may
be wanted after using `:set ignorecase` to make searches case insensitive.


#### Search scope ####

| Example                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `:s/foo/bar/g`          | Change each `foo` to `bar` in the current line.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `:%s/foo/bar/g`         | Change each `foo` to `bar` in all lines.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `:5,12s/foo/bar/g`      | Change each `foo` to `bar` for all lines from line 5 to line 12 inclusive.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `:'a,'bs/foo/bar/g`     | Change each `foo` to `bar` for all lines from mark a to mark b inclusive (see Note below).                                                                                                                                                  |
| `:'<,'>s/foo/bar/g`     | When compiled with +visual, change each `foo` to `bar` for all lines within a visual selection. Vim automatically appends the visual selection range (`'<,'>`) for any ex command when you select an area and enter:. Also, see Note below. |
| `:.,$s/foo/bar/g`       | Change each `foo` to `bar` for all lines from the current line (.) to the last line ($) inclusive.                                                                                                                                          |
| `:.,+2s/foo/bar/g`      | Change each `foo` to `bar` for the current line (.) and the two next lines (+2).                                                                                                                                                            |
| `:g/^baz/s/foo/bar/g`   | Change each `foo` to `bar` in each line starting with 'baz'.                                                                                                                                                                                |

**Note:** As of Vim 7.3, substitutions applied to a range defined by marks or a
visual selection (which uses a special type of marks `'<` and `'>`) are not
bounded by the column position of the marks by default. Instead, Vim applies
the substitution to the entire line on which each mark appears unless the
`\%V` atom is used in the pattern like: `:'<,'>s/\%Vfoo/bar/g`.

### [Repeat](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat) ###

Repeat.vim remaps `.` in a way that plugins can tap into
it.

The following plugins support repeat.vim:

* [surround.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)
* [speeddating.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-speeddating)
* [abolish.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish)
* [unimpaired.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-unimpaired)
* [commentary.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)


### [BufferGator](https://github.com/jeetsukumaran/vim-buffergator) ###

List, navigate and select buffers.

* Open buffer list: `<Leader>b`
* Close buffer list: `<Leader>B` or `q`
* Open tab list: `<Leader>t`
* Close  tab list: `<Leader>T`
* Navigage up/down in lists: `k` or `CTRL+n` or `SPACE` / `j` or `CTRL-p` or `CTRL-SPACE`
* Open selected buffer in previous window: `o` or `ENTER`
* Open selected buffer in new tab: `t`
* Rebuild catalogue: `r`
* Wipe selected buffer: `x`
* Wipe selected buffer with prejudice: `X`


### [Surround.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/surround.vim)

Wrap text with quotation marks, brackets, tags etc. [TL;DR](#summary)

Surround.vim is all about "surroundings": parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML tags, and more.  The plugin provides mappings to easily delete, change and add such surroundings in pairs.

It's easiest to explain with examples.  Press `cs"'` inside

    "Hello world!"

to change it to

    'Hello world!'

Now press `cs'<q>` to change it to

    <q>Hello world!</q>

To go full circle, press `cst"` to get

    "Hello world!"

To remove the delimiters entirely, press `ds"`.

    Hello world!

Now with the cursor on "Hello", press `ysiw]` (`iw` is a text object).

    [Hello] world!

Let's make that braces and add some space (use `}` instead of `{` for no
space): `cs]{`

    { Hello } world!

Now wrap the entire line in parentheses with `yssb` or `yss)`.

    ({ Hello } world!)

Revert to the original text: `ds{ds)`

    Hello world!

Emphasize hello: `ysiw<em>`

    <em>Hello</em> world!

Finally, let's try out visual mode. Press a capital V (for linewise visual mode) followed by `S<p class="important">`.

    <p class="important">
      <em>Hello</em> world!
    </p>

This plugin is very powerful for HTML and XML editing, a niche which currently seems underfilled in Vim land.  (As opposed to HTML/XML *inserting*, for which many plugins are available).  Adding, changing, and removing pairs of tags simultaneously is a breeze.

The `.` command will work with `ds`, `cs`, and `yss` if you install
[repeat.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat).

| None         | `:Git ...`  | git ...    |

Command `:Git ...` is like calling `git` in a terminal, but it changes to the working directory first.

When the Fugitive status window is open, use the following keys:

| Mapping | Action                                     |

| `C`     | commit                                     |
| `q`     | close status window                        |
| `D`     | `:Gdiff` — diff a Fugitive revision        |
| `p`     | add --patch / reset --patch (staged files) |
| `o`     | `:Gsplit` — `:split` a Fugitive revision   |

### [Tasklist](https://github.com/vim-scripts/TaskList.vim)

Show interactive list of TODO FIXME and similar tags.

| Mapping      | Command     | Action         |
| ------       | ----------- | ------         |
| `<leader>td` | `:TaskList` | Open task list |


### [Gundo](https://github.com/sjl/gundo.vim)

Navigate the `vim` undo tree. Toggle with `:GundoToggle`. I have mapped this to `<F5>`.

| Mapping | Action                                     |
| ------  | -----------                                |
| `p`     | Preview diff of current and selected state |
| `P`     | "Play" to the selected state               |
| `q`     | Close the undo graph                       |


### [Scriptease](https://github.com/tpope/vim-scriptease) ###

A script for making plugins. Contains convenience functions.

* `:PP`: Pretty print.  With no argument, acts as a REPL.
* `:Runtime`: Reload runtime files.  Like `:runtime!`, but it unlets any
  include guards first.
* `:Disarm`: Remove a runtime file's maps, commands, and autocommands,
  effectively disabling it.
* `:Scriptnames`: Load `:scriptnames` into the quickfix list.
* `:Verbose`: Capture the output of a `:verbose` invocation into the preview
  window.
* `:Time`: Measure how long a command takes.
* `:Breakadd`: Like its lowercase cousin, but makes it much easier to set
  breakpoints inside functions.  Also `:Breakdel`.
* `:Vedit`: Edit a file relative the runtime path. For example,
  `:Vedit plugin/scriptease.vim`. Also, `:Vsplit`, `:Vtabedit`, etc.
  Extracted from [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
* `K`: Look up the `:help` for the VimL construct under the cursor.
* `zS`: Show the active syntax highlighting groups under the cursor.
* `g!`: Eval a motion or selection as VimL and replace it with the result.
  This is handy for doing math, even outside of VimL.  It's so handy, in fact,
  that it probably deserves its own plugin.
* Projections for
  [projectionist.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-projectionist).
