Snippet collection for Alfred based on [Wikipedia's list of common misspellings][source].

<!--more-->

This is a snippet collection for Alfred 4+ to "autocorrect" [Wikipedia's list of common misspellings][source]. Inspired by [this forum thread][thread].

The Wikipedia list often contains multiple corrections for each misspelling. As a snippet can only contain one correction per misspelling, I've had to remove all but one of the alternatives. Generally, I've tried to pick the most common or obvious correction, and in the case of US and UK spellings, the British one.

**Note**: Many keywords are prefixes of other keywords, so auto-expansion won't work with this snippet collection. Alternatively, you can disable the duplicates, which Alfred will mark red if you turn on auto-expansion.
