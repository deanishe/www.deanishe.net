Snippet collection for Alfred based on [Wikipedia's list of common misspellings][source].

<!--more-->

This is a snippet collection for Alfred 4+ to "autocorrect" [Wikipedia's list of common misspellings][source]. Inspired by [this forum thread][thread].

**Note**: Many keywords are prefixes of other keywords, so auto-expansion won't work with this snippet collection. Alternatively, you can disable the duplicates, which Alfred will mark red if you turn on auto-expansion.
