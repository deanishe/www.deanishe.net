Do-nothing workflow that shows how to use modifiers and filters in
an Alfred Workflow.

<!--more-->

Note that the workflow uses an outdated (but working) feedback format.
It's no longer necessary to serialise a `alfredworkflow` object into
`arg`: `mod` is now a much richer object, with support for `variables`
and `args` fields.

From [this forum thread][thread].
