Alfred workflow to run your Web Searches via suffix keywords.

<!--more-->

Instead of typing `<search keyword> <query>`, you type
`<workflow keyword> <query> <search keyword>` (where
`<workflow keyword>` is something very short).

This way, you can enter your search query first and then choose
which search engine to search with, or easily come back and
use a different search engine.

Built to solve [this request on AlfredForum.com][thread].
