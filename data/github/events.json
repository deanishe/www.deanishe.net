How I currently have that one working is that you can set variables at the `Workflow`, `Item` or `Modifier` level. When you create a new `Item` or `Modifier`, it inherits its parent's variables _at the time of creation_. So you can do:\n\n``` go\nwf.SetVar(\"api_key\", api_key) // Inherited by all child Items\n\nit := wf.NewItem(\"Item Title\")\nit.Subtitle = \"Open in New Window\"\nit.SetVar(\"uuid\", uuid)  // Inherited by child Modifiers\n\n// CMD\nm := it.NewModifier(\"cmd\")\nm.Subtitle = \"Open in New Tab\"\nm.SetVar(\"open_in_tab\", \"1\")\n\n// ALT\nm = it.NewModifier(\"alt\")\nm.Subtitle = \"Open in Private Window\"\nm.SetVar(\"open_in_private\", \"1\")\n\nit.SetVar(\"open_in_win\", \"1\") // Only set on Item, not Modifiers\n```\n\nIs that a solid solution for Alfred-Workflow? Too complex? Should variables (and arg) be resolved at feedback-generation time instead (i.e. `vars = wf.vars.copy(); vars.update(item.vars); vars.update(mod.vars)`)?\n\nOr is variable inheritance a fundamentally bad idea?\n\nCould maybe even make different `Feedback` classes with different variable inheritance behaviour.\n"

        "body": "Will do. I'll have to have a think about how best to handle workflow and environment variables.\r\n\r\nThe implementation changed in 6b1fc2c, as Alfred 3.2 added \"real\" top-level workflow variables Previously `Workflow3.setvar()` was just a convenience to set variables on all `Item3` objects. Now it really sets top-level workflow variables (not that there's a lot of difference in practice).\r\n\r\nI suspect what @ViViDboarder suggested is how most people would expect and/or prefer it to work, but I'm leery of conflating the \"real\" environment (i.e. `os.environ`) and workflow variables too much because they're not the same. For example, `$HOME` isn't a workflow variable (i.e. you can't do `{var:HOME}` in an Args & Vars Utility).\r\n\r\nIf `Workflow3.getvar()` gets a value from `os.environ`, should it \"import\" the variable, so it *is* set for downstream workflow objects (e.g. `Workflow.getvar('HOME')` would automatically make `{var:HOME}` work downstream)? If not, a user might think they're using a workflow variable when it's actually from `os.environ` and won't be visible to downstream objects.\r\n\r\nIf `Workflow3.getvar()` reads from `os.environ`, should `Workflow3.setvar()` also write to `os.environ` (so the variables would also be set when you call `run_in_background()` or `subprocess.call()`, and not just for downstream objects)?"
